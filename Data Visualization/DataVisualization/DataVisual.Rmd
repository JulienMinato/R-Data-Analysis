This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Environment setup
```{r setup, echo=T, results='hide', error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60), tidy = TRUE)

library(Sleuth3)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)

# 1. Data Visualization

Data Visualization is regarded by many disciplines as a modern concept that has the same meaning as visual communication. It involves the creation and research of the visual representation of data. Data visualization is both an art and a science.

# 2. ggplot2

```{r}
print(mpg)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))


```



```{r}
#You can add a third variable to the two-dimensional scatter plot, such as class, square
#The formula is to map it as a graphical attribute.
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(
  mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```



```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```



```{r}



#Left 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

#Right
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class, color = model))


```


```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(
    mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```
